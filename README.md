# Laundry Management System

# Software Engineering Project - CSD 326

The current state of college laundry services often leaves much to be desired, with students
facing various inconveniences due to a lack of structure and efficient communication channels.
This results in challenges such as an information gap, inefficient communication methods, limited feedback channels, and difficulties in managing lost and found items. To address these
issues, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive solution that enhances the overall management of student laundry services.

The proposed system aims to tackle these challenges head-on by offering a robust platform for managing laundry services tailored specifically to the needs of college students. By implementing features such as secure login and user authentication, a student laundry portal, a lost and found page, a complaint box, admin views for laundry management, and efficient communication channels, the system endeavors to streamline and enhance the laundry experience for both students and administrators.

This introduction sets the stage for discussing the goals and objectives of the proposed system, which are centered around addressing the identified challenges and improving the overall efficiency, transparency, and user experience of college laundry services. Through careful design and implementation, the system aims to mitigate existing issues while providing students with a seamless and convenient laundry management solution.


# Information on running the Code

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
